Regarding the solution i decided to use IntelliJ as the IDE as i am more trained in using that , also 
to configure all the specific dependencies in the pom file.
Regarding it i considered the specific Jbehave plugin, selenium and junit. I then also downloaded the
Chrome WebDriver for the specific version available on my pc , version 108.0.5359.125.

Then i defined the *.story file (similarly to the .feature file in Cucumber) considereing the 
Given,When,Then format and i defined the 2 following scenarios (one positive and one negative in which
the failure is expected --> tracked via assertion).

Scenario: Search for keyword on Google homepage
Given I am on the Google homepage
When I search for the keyword "JBehave"
Then the search results should include the string "What is JBehave?"

Scenario: Search for different keyword on Google
Given I am on the Google homepage
When I search for the keyword "Cucumber"
Then the search results should NOT include the string "What is JBehave?"

Then i continued by creating the specific Class file (googleTest.java) containing the implementation
and mapping with the specific steps defined in the *.story file.

Within the class i defined the WebDriver and WebDriverWait as private and then decided to instantiate
a new driver to each @Given method implemented (single in this case).

Then within the openGoogleHomepage method i instantiate the drivers, open the specific URL
wait for the appeareance of a specific pop up (acceptance of cookies handling) and then
click it away by accepting it and finally maximize the window

The specific button was identified by ID = L2AGLb
The @When method is then identifying the search input field by NAME = "q" and through the sendkey
command insert the specified searched string and giving the "ENTER" command.

Then the @Then methods are splitted in 2 , as positive and negative assertion.
Then verifySearchResults method is waiting to the appeareance of the first result in the search , 
located by TAGNAME = "h3" , then it asserts that the text (via getText()) of the identified
page element is equal to the expected String provided via the scenario (stripping of " is introduce).

The verifySearchResultsNegative method is providing an assertion that the searched information
does not contain an expedcted text (assertNotEquals).

Both of those method are terminating the driver after execution.

Finally i moved to the Runner class creation Gstory.java in which i extended the 
JUnitStories class and provided the information on where to find the *.story file and its
corresponding Step implementation.

Execution is currently sequential.


IMPROVEMENTS:

- specify regex to be used to track the steps in the story file and the implementation
- introduce data tables to handle more specific configuration with the same Given,When,Then format
- introduce @Before , @After to set up and tear down the specific driver
- introduce the specification to define a specific driver to different browsers to be used
- improve logging
- introduce tagging for specific scenario separation and execution
- define additional scenarios to be executed
